[View the JIRA tracker for status updates!](https://sydstudios.atlassian.net/projects/SYDOS)

SydOS is designed to be a lightweight and small server OS. Expandable to fit your needs, it starts light and adds only what you need/want.

Currently SydOS is in a very early stage and won't be useful to you as a business. If your interested in helping, send me an email. You can find it on my GitHub profile.
